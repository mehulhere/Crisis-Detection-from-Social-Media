5. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text to numerical features

## Deployment

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Data Collection
# Run Interface.ipynb to collect new tweet data

# 2. Model Training
# Run ML_Project_Tweet_Detection.ipynb to train/update models

# 3. Real-time Monitoring
# Use trained models for live crisis detection

# 4. Visualization
# Generate updated maps and visualizations
```

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model and vectorizer
model = joblib.load('final_mlp_model.joblib')
vectorizer = joblib.load('tfidf_vectorizer.joblib')

# Load and process new data
new_tweets = pd.read_csv('latest_tweets_data.csv')

# Transform text data
X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_tweets['text'])

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_new)
```

### Interactive Map Visualization

# Open cleaned_tweets_map.html in a web browser
# Or use Python to display in Jupyter
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame('cleaned_tweets_map.html', width=800, height=600)
```
